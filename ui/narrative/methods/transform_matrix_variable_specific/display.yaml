description : |
    <p> Apply a series of operations to input matrix. </p>

    <p> Currently only supports one specification of parameters per operation. </p>

    <p>
    Currently, if any of the input, output, or intermediate matrices contains NaN, infinity,
    complex numbers, etc., or are empty, the behavior of this app will be unspecified.
    Also, saved KBase objects at the moment can capture only integers, floats, and null numbers.
    </p>
