            Taxonomic Abundance TSV File Path
        short-hint : |
            TSV file contains metadata as well as amplicon matrix values. Headers specified in Metadata Keys field will be used to build AttributeMapping while rest of headers will be used as sample names to build AmpliconMatrix.

        ui-name : |
            FASTA File Path
        short-hint : |
            FASTA file contains consensus sequence. Sequence name/identifier must match amplicon(row) names in associated TSV file
